# Breast-Cancer-Classification-Deep-Learning-Project
This Project involved developing a binary classification model for breast cancer detection using Deep Learning. It achieved a 95% accuracy rate on the Wisconsin Breast dataset. The project employed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), fine-tuned hyperparameters, and utilized Python, TensorFlow, and Keras. Data preprocessing techniques, including feature scaling and data augmentation, were implemented. Challenges included optimizing model generalization, and addressing potential data biases and class imbalances.
